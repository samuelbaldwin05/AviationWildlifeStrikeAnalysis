# Aviation Wildlife Strike Analysis 
Analyzing bird strikes on airplanes over time using data from the Federal Aviation Administration Wildlife Strike Database. Data was split and analyzed by state, years, phase of flight, bird type, month of strike, time of day, and region. Additionally, a logistic regression was used to predict future strikes per year, predicting a further upward trend. 



# Question at hand
The task involves analyzing data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Strike Database, which records incidents where wildlife—primarily birds—strikes civil aircraft in the U.S. between 1990 and 2023. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in these incidents, focusing on their frequency, geographic distribution, and impact on aviation safety. Key elements to investigate include annual changes in incidents, common wildlife species involved, and damage caused during different phases of flight. The data also allows for examining environmental or operational factors contributing to strike increases over time. Ultimately, the goal is to identify significant trends that could inform strategies to reduce future wildlife strikes.


# Findings
This analysis provided a comprehensive exploration of bird strike incidents involving aircraft from 1990 to 2023, identifying key trends, patterns, and statistical relationships. Firstly, the analysis revealed a clear upward trend in bird strikes over the years, with dips during 2020 and 2021 attributed to reduced flights during COVID and incomplete data for 2023. Second, incidents were most frequent during flight phases such as approach and landing roll, and there was a significant seasonal pattern, with higher bird strikes during late summer and fall, likely due to increased bird activity and flight frequency. Lastly, statistical testing confirmed that flight phase is significantly related to aircraft damage, and the linear regression model showed high predictive accuracy (R² = 0.97), effectively forecasting incidents up to 2020, though predictions beyond that period require cautious interpretation.
